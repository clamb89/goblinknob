## About the Collection

These images and videos were captured during the late winter months, and some of them are located in the higher-elevation engleman spruce/subalpine fir forest--a primary winter location for mountain caribou. Because of the season, the footage here is limited. Few critters make it to higher elevations until the snow has melted.  

What you might see:

- Deer
- Trees and lichen in the wind
- Hikers
- Birds
- Snow

Ordered list:

1. One
2. Two
3. Three

This site is generated using [`collectionbuilder-gh`](https://collectionbuilding.github.io/gh/), a project to create a free and simple digital collection using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) from: 

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of JPEG images or PDF documents

The base site features four objects from the University of Idaho Library's [Digital Collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital).
