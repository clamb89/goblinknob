## About the Collection

These images and videos were captured during the late winter months and some of them are located in the higher-elevation engleman spruce/subalpine fir forest--a primary winter location for mountain caribou. Because of the season, the footage here is limited. Few critters make it to higher elevations until the snow has melted.  

**Dave Boswell describes hiking to Goblin Knob during his decades-long search for the elusive mountain or "black" caribou.** *"I've hiked into Goblin Knob, Looking,"* **he shares in a 2020 interview.** *"It's wild up there,on Goblin Knobb, near the Selkirk Crest"* **says Dave. Indeed it is.**

What you might see:

- Deer
- Trees and lichen in the wind
- Hikers
- Birds
- Snow

### What is Storying Extinction?

*Storying Extinction: Responding to the Loss of North Idaho’s Mountain Caribou* is a multidisciplinary digital humanities project aimed at representing community response to the recent extirpation (2019) of mountain caribou from the South Selkirk mountains of North Idaho—the last caribou to inhabit the coterminous United States. The collection takes the form of a deep map, or multimodal spatial narrative, and is comprised of trail camera footage from former caribou habitat and oral histories from locals who encountered caribou in the wild prior to their extirpation.
